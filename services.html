                <h1><span>Benefits of Pet Ownership:</span></h1>

                <p>Lower cholesterol and triglycerides. People with pets have been found to have
                lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels when compared to people who did not
                have pets, even when matched for weight, diet, and smoking habits. Decrease
                blood pressure and reduce stress. Studies of people undergoing stress tests or
                physical examinations have demonstrated that the presence of a dog lowered
                their heart rate and blood pressure during testing. Be less anxious and feel
                safer. Pet owners tend to feel less afraid of being a victim of crime when
                walking with a dog or having a dog in the home.</p>

                <p>Relax and reduce everyday stress. Pets can help us relax and focus our
                attention away from our problems and worries. Lift our mood and feel less
                lonely. Pets decrease our feelings of loneliness and isolation by providing
                companionship to all generations.</p>

                <p>Have something to care for. Everyone needs to feel needed and have
                something to care for. Many elderly citizens or people living alone will tell you
                their pet gives them a reason for living.</p>

                <p>Keep active. Having a pet can help us remain more active. We may not only get
                more exercise from walking a dog, but we also increase our activity through
                feeding, grooming, and otherwise caring for our pet.</p>

                <p>Have consistency. Pets provide some consistency to our lives. Caring for a pet
                can significantly affect our routine and gives us something to do and look
                forward to each day.</p>

                <p>Create a sense of closeness and well-being. Families surveyed before and after
                they acquired a pet reported feeling happier after adding a pet to the family.</p>

                <h1>Benefits of Concierge Services:</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>Time – You will be given the precious gift of time! This allows you to do
                        the things that matter to you the most.</li>
                    <li>Stress Reduction – You will no doubt have a lower stress level by allowing
                        a trustworthy and reliable concierge do those tedious jobs that bring you
                        stress.</li>
                    <li>Convenience – Look at how convenient it would be to have someone else
                        run your errands.</li>
                    <li>Increased Productivity – You could increase productivity by having
                        someone else run your errands, organize your home or office, and do
                        many of those multi-tasking jobs that keep you busy.</li>
                    <li>High Quality Service – Relying on a family member or neighbor to take
                        care of some of your tasks may not always be a good solution. The family
                        member or neighbor may not take the tasks as serious as a professional
                        concierge. Remember, the concierge service has their reputation at
                        stake.</li>
                    <li>Peace of Mind – Knowing that things are done at the right place, at the
                        right time, by the right person, will give you that ultimate peace of mind!</li>
                    <li>Affordability – Ask yourself how much an hour of your time is worth and
                        you will find that hiring a personal concierge is cost effective.</li>
